"The Odin is a \"ship\" so large and unique that it's almost a class of its "
"own.\n"
"\n"
"The ship is often nicknamed the \"all-father\", a name that aptly describes "
"the many roles this ship can fulfill. It's both a supply station and an "
"extremely heavily armored and shielded weapon station capable of "
"annihilating small fleets on its own.\n"
"\n"
"Odin's core contains the largest jump drive ever created. About 150 support "
"crew are needed to operate the jump drive alone, and it takes 5 days of "
"continuous operation to power it.\n"
"\n"
"Due to the enormous cost of this Dreadnought, only the richest star systems "
"are able to build and maintain ships like the Odin.\n"
"\n"
"This machine's primary tactic is to jump into an unsuspecting enemy system "
"and destroy everything before they know what hit them. It's effective and "
"destructive, but extremely expensive."
