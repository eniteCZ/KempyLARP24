"Stations of this size are often used as research outposts, listening "
"stations, and security checkpoints. Crews turn over frequently in a small "
"station's cramped accommodatations, but they are small enough to look like "
"ships on many long-range sensors, and organized raiders sometimes take "
"advantage of this by placing small stations in nebulae to serve as raiding "
"bases. They are lightly shielded and vulnerable to swarming assaults."

"Large enough to accommodate small crews for extended periods of times, "
"stations of this size are often trading posts, refuelling bases, mining "
"operations, and forward military bases. While their shields are strong, "
"concerted attacks by many ships can bring them down quickly."

"These spaceborne communities often represent permanent bases in a sector. "
"Stations of this size can be military installations, commercial hubs, deep-"
"space settlements, and small shipyards. Only a concentrated attack can "
"penetrate a large station's shields, and its hull can withstand all but the "
"most powerful weaponry."

"The size of a sprawling town, stations at this scale represent a faction's "
"center of spaceborne power in a region. They serve many functions at once "
"and represent an extensive investment of time, money, and labor. A huge "
"station's shields and thick hull can keep it intact long enough for "
"reinforcements to arrive, even when faced with an ongoing siege or massive, "
"perfectly coordinated assault."
