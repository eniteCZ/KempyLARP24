# Scenario description
msgid ""
"Since its creation, the Shangri-La station was governed by a multi-ethnic "
"consortium that assured the station's independence across the conflicts that "
"shook the sector.\n"
"\n"
"However, the station's tranquility came to an abrupt end when most of the "
"governing consortium's members were assassinated under a Exuari false flag "
"operation.\n"
"\n"
"Now the station is in a state of civil war, with infighting breaking out "
"between warring factions.\n"
"\n"
"Both the neighboring Human Navy and Kraylor are worried that the breakdown "
"of order in Shangri-La could tilt the balance of power in their opponent's "
"favor, and sent \"peacekeepers\" to shift the situation to their own "
"advantage.\n"
"\n"
"The Human Navy's HNS Gallipoli and Kraylor's Crusader Naa'Tvek face off in "
"an all-out battle for Shangri-La."
